![A badass Nerf gun](/images/nerf-rayven.jpg)

 This gun pictured above is not your typical Nerf blaster. It's modified to run at 3.75x the standard voltage, making it very powerful and very painful. It runs at 22.5 volts, a considerable increase from the stock voltage of 6.

This is a very simple modification, one that you can do in a few minutes if you have the batteries and the patience. I used a Makita 18v compact battery to supply the bulk of the voltage. It's rechargable, compact, and designed to be used in high-load situations. The other 4.5v are supplied by three standard AA batteries.

To perform the modification, first put the three AA batteries into the three left-hand battery slots on the Rayven. After that, attach your Makita battery (or any other battery) to the positive/negative contacts in the fourth battery slot. Make sure not to reverse the polarity accidentally. Duct tape your external battery to an aesthetically pleasing location on the Rayven, and you're good to go!
