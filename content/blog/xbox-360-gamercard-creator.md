A month ago I wrote and published the [Xbox 360 Gamertag API](/blog/x360-api), which is an API that allows programmers to access gamertag information from Microsoft's Xbox Live. One month later, I have mostly completed an example that uses said API: the Xbox 360 Gamercard Creator. It outputs images for use as signatures on forums and stuff. Here's an example:
