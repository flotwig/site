*EDIT: Recently, PayBox.me changed its name to VirtaPay in an attempt to get away from all the bad press they have gotten recently.*

Many of you have heard of the free service named VirtaPay. VirtaPay purports to give users $25 in exchange for signing up, and give out an additional $10 for every new user they refer in a structure strangely similar to a pyramid scheme. Aside from that, this site sounds pretty good, right? Everybody should go and cash in on this once-in-a-lifetime chance to get rich quick.

Unfortunately for us, it is almost certainly a scam.

First of all, when VirtaPay says they will give you $25 for signing up, they are not referring to United States Dollars, as you might expect. Instead, they are referring to VirtaPay dollars - a propitiatory and unregistered virtual Internet currency that is not backed by anything even remotely valuable.

Think about it for a moment. Nearly every currency on Earth is or has been backed by a tangible good. The United States Dollar, for example, used to be backed by gold - every dollar was worth its weight in gold, and you could exchange it any time. What are VirtaPay dollars backed by? Absolutely nothing.

For a while, VirtaPay had a shopping service where you could exchange your virtual Monopoly money for "real goods and services". Unsurprisingly, this little experiment failed quickly once the VirtaPay administrators realized that it was completely unsustainable. I have yet to meet a person who is satisfied with a purchase they made while the shop was still alive.

So what do you think? Personally, I'm staying as far away from this shady scam as I can.
