The source code of my personal site at za.chary.us

Goals
-----

 * Be concise
 * Be efficient
 * Be secure
 * Be functional
 
To achieve these ends, this project will:

 * Query the filesystem as little as possible
 * Avoid extraneous output
 * Enforce reasonable client-side caching whenever possible
 * Take minimal user input, and never directly use user input
