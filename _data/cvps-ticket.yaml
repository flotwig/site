We have checked and your VPS is up and working fine. You are getting this error due to some temporary problem on server. It will get resolved soon. This will not effect on functionality of your 

vps.

    note: "\"Your server's down, so everything is working as expected.\" It took *four hours* for ChicagoVPS to tell me that my service is \"working fine\". Guess what? It's still down."

    content: "It's not up. SSH is inaccessible, HTTP is down, SolusVM link seems to be non existent. I am going to chargeback unless this is resolved soon. The hostname on the account does not point to ChicagoVPS currently, I am waiting for my ChicagoVPS to become available. The IP address allocated to me, 198.46.148.192, is down. And for some reason, this ticket has a different IP address attached to it than the IP address attached to my service."

Should we setup new server for you?"
    note: "**New server?!** Well, I'd prefer the server I paid for almost a day ago, but at this point I'll take anything..."

    note: "Threatening a chargeback is a low thing to do, but at this point I just want to get my service which I ordered over 24 hours ago up and running."

Please make sure after this process your data will be lot. Please advise. "
