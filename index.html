<h4>About Me</h4>
<hr/>
<p>Hi, I'm Zach. I'm an Atlanta-based software engineer with extensive experience in developing Node.js applications. <!-- TODO: something else about "A team" -->I enjoy working with a wide variety of technologies, and I especially love contributing to open source software.</p>
<p>When I'm not writin' codes, you can find me biking around the city, trying to cook something new, or playing with the <a href="/assets/best-cats.jpg">best cats</a> ever.</p>
<!-- TODO: make less verbose/technical --><p>Previously, I helped build the <a href="https://www.cypress.io">Cypress Test Runner</a>, an open-source, cross-platform, cross-browser web application testing framework built in Electron. I led the collaborative API design and implementation process for the novel <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept"><code>cy.intercept()</code></a> API, which allows users to intercept and assert on HTTP requests and responses in real time. This was a multi-year effort that redefined how Cypress users test their applications. I was also responsible for maintaining and extending the code used to automate Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. And <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aflotwig+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acomments-desc">more!</a>
<p>You may know me from my work on the <a href="https://snoonet.org">Snoonet IRC Network</a>, where I am a founding member. I also have a wide assortment of open source <a href="https://github.com/flotwig?tab=repositories&type=source">projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aflotwig&type=pullrequests&s=&o=desc">contributions</a>.</p>
