		Room was a hackathon project which a company picked up and supported the further development of for
		their developer relations booth at CES 2016. It's a crowd-sourced DJing app that allows a room of
		people to choose the music playing as opposed to a singular DJ choosing the song. We built it for
		Android and iOS using Parse as the backend API. It won first prize in a section of the hackathon.

		<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.room"><span>flomon</span></a>
		flomon is a comprehensive server and application monitor. It is controlled by a secure web-based
		frontend written in PHP and Laravel. This is my first real Laravel project. It can monitor HTTP, it
		can execute commands on servers, and it requires no agent to do these tasks. This makes it very
		lightweight on resources and very simple to operate with multiple distributed servers.

		<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.room"><span>NagMe</span></a>
		NagMe is a task management app which reminds you to complete tasks based on your availability. It
		compares your calendar availability to the time estimates you assign to your tasks and will
		repeatedly nag you to finish the task when you have free time. Tasks are prioritized by due date.
		This is the first Android app I've made that is entirely my own development.
